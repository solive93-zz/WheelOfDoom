# Wheel of Doom (WoD)

## Our very first group project developed in Factoria F5 Bootcamp

This WoD project was the first group project we developed in Factoria F5 Bootcamp, mimicking a developers' team working under SCRUM methodology. 

The aim of the WoD is to randomly 'kill' a 'coder'. By *kill* I mean selecting a name from a list of names when the 'kill' button is clicked. And by *coder* I mean one of the students of the Bootcamp. The name selected by the program cannot be repeated until all tha names have already been selected. 

In the real life, every morning before we start the classes, the WoD will be used to pick one of us randomly. The 'coder' selected by the program will have to present his "Coding Pill" (a 10 minutes talk about a topic related to programming); The topics of the pills may range from AI or 'Machine Learning' to 'Mindfulness in Dev Teams' (including anything in-between). 

===============================================================================

My team and I developed this project in 3 sprints (of 1 week each). On the one hand I'm happy we were one of the 2 teams that managed to finish the project withing the 3 weeks that we had, and the program ran smoothly despite the fact that this was our first project. On the other hand though, the code was too *spahettish* (jeje). I'll try to refactor it. 

Overall, I'm proud of our Wheel of Doom. I personally learnt about Repository Design Pattern, even though I didn't fully understand why to use it until a fer weeks later. We learn how to store data both in a MySQL database and a json file, and gained some experience and understanding of TDD and how to write a unit test. (stored either in a json file or MySQL database).

**Disclaimer:** The Front End that you'll see in my repo is not the originat one. I decided to re-design and implement my own Front-End.
